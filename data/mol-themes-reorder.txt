MASTER OF LOGIC: THEMES
Ulle Endriss, 30 June 2015

Note that some courses are listed under more than one theme.

BASIC SKILLS
- Basic Logic
- Basic Probability, Computing and Statistics
[The Python programming language is introduced in the latter course. 
To learn Haskell, take Functional Specification of Algorithms. 
Other programming languages are occasionally covered in project courses.]

MATHEMATICAL LOGIC
- Proof Theory
- Model Theory
- Recursion Theory
- Axiomatic Set Theory
- Set Theory [2015/16 only]
- Introduction to Modal Logic
- Capita Selecta Modal Logic, Algebra, Coalgebra
- Mathematical Structures in Logic
- Homotopy Type Theory
- Category Theory and Topos Theory [2015/16 only]
- Seminar Mathematical Logic
[Regarding the two set theory courses, Set Theory is recommended for students 
with a strong mathematical background; Axiomatic Set Theory will cover less 
material and be more accessible to non-mathematicians. You cannot take both courses.]
[Modal Logic has a special status in that modal logic plays an important role 
also in several of the less mathematically oriented logic courses, as well as 
some of the formal semantics and philosophical courses. It also has applications
in Computer Science and AI. Most students should consider taking it.]

PHILOSOPHICAL LOGIC
- Philosophical Logic
- Dynamic Epistemic Logic
- Logic, Knowledge and Science
- Possible Worlds: Logic and Metaphysics
- Kant, Logic and Cognition
- Logic and Conversation

FORMAL SEMANTICS AND PRAGMATICS
- Meaning, Reference and Modality
- Structures for Semantics
- Semantics and Grammar
- Causality and Explanation
- Logic and Conversation
- Computational Pragmatics
- Semantics and Pragmatics in Bayesian Interpretation 

COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
- Natural Language Processing 1
- Natural Language Processing 2
- Unsupervised Language Learning
- Computational Pragmatics
- Semantics and Pragmatics in Bayesian Interpretation 
[The first three of the above courses particularly emphases the 
statistical/machine learning perspective on computational linguistics. 
Students taking these courses are expected to be familiar with the kind of 
material covered in Basic Probability, Computing and Statistics. Some students 
may want to combine them with some of the straight machine learning courses 
from the MSc AI.]

COGNITION
[Courses range from philosophical foundations to mathematical and computational
modelling. Some address specific aspects of cognition (language, music).]
- Neurophilosophy of the Self
- The Computational Mind and its Critics
- Kant, Logic and Cognition
- Rationality, Cognition and Reasoning
- Logical Methods in Cognitive Science
- Foundations of Neural and Cognitive Modelling
- Cognitive Models of Language and Music
- Music Cognition
[Some students may wish to look for further electives from the offerings of 
the MSc Brain and Cognitive Science.]

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
[The main AI themes represented at the ILLC and in the MoL are Natural Language 
Processing (and Machine Learning as far as it is useful for NLP), Knowledge 
Representation and Reasoning, and Multiagent Systems.] 
- NLP: all of the courses listed under Computational Linguistics
- KRR: Knowledge Representation
- KRR: Knowledge Representation for the Web
- MAS: Computational Social Choice [not in 2015/16]
[Note that description logics (taught in the KRR courses) are very closely
related to modal logics, so it makes sense to combine the relevant courses.]
[Students interested in AI may want to pick additional courses from the MSc AI.]

THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
[Some people distinguish "TCS A" (algorithms and complexity) from "TCS B" 
(with its origins in the study of the semantics of programming languages).]
- A: Computational Complexity
- A: Quantum Computing [not in 2015/16]
- A: Combinatorics with Computer Science Applications
- A: Information Theory
- A: Kolmogorov Complexity
- A: Introduction to Modern Cryptography
- B: Computability and Interaction
- B: Functional Specification of Algorithms 
- B: Protocol Validation
- B: Concurrency Theory
- B: Lambda Calculus
[Some students may also want to looks for other courses from the MSc Computer 
Science programme at the VU, particularly from its Foundations track.]

ECONOMIC THEORY
- Game Theory
- Computational Social Choice [not in 2015/16]
[There are further game theory courses in the Economics department.
Some of the courses listed under philosophical logic also take up the 
game-theoretical themes, notably Dynamic Epistemic Logic and Logic, Knowledge 
and Science.]

PHILOSOPHY
[Courses in philosophy cover Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Language, 
Philosophy of Mind, and Metaphysics.] 
- PoS: Philosophy of Mathematics
- PoS: Philosophy of Science
- PoS: Logic, Knowledge and Science
- PoL: Meaning, Reference and Modality
- PoL: Introduction to the Philosophy of Language
- PoL: Advanced Topics in the Philosophy of Language
- PoL: Wittgenstein's Relevance: Sources
- PoL: Wittgenstein's Relevance: Perspectives
- PoL: Early Modern Philosophy of Language
- PoM: Neurophilosophy of the Self
- PoM: The Computational Mind and its Critics
- Meta: Possible Worlds: Logic and Metaphysics
[Some students may also be interested in some of the other courses offered 
in the MA Philosophy.]

HARD TO CLASSIFY
- Logic, Language and Computation
- Time
- Studies of Mathematical and Logical Practice
[But note that the Studies course is specifically intended to be taken together 
with Philosophy of Mathematics.]
